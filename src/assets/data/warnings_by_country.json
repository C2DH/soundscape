  "France": "France’s Signal National d’Alerte (SNA) was introduced after the Second World War and standardized during the Cold War, when a nationwide acoustic system was deemed essential for both air-raid and civil protection scenarios. The chosen pattern consists of three cycles of a rising and falling tone, each lasting one minute and 41 seconds, separated by five-second pauses (Arrêté du 23 mars 2007, cited in Sénat report; senat.fr). This distinctive cycle was designed to be long enough to ensure recognition and short enough to avoid confusion with other alarms such as fire sirens. The Ministry of the Interior explains that the design makes the sound “clairement audible et mobilisateur sans être anxiogène” (“clearly audible and mobilizing without being anxiety-inducing”), a balance intended to draw attention without triggering unnecessary panic (Ministère de l’Intérieur, Historique de l’alerte, mobile.interieur.gouv.fr).\nThe system is tested monthly on the first Wednesday at noon, with the full three-cycle alert followed by the all-clear, a 30-second steady tone. Officials describe the sound as “reconnaissable grâce à un son montant et descendant” (“recognizable thanks to a rising and falling sound”), underlining its intended clarity (Ministère de l’Intérieur, Comment réagir au signal national d’alerte, mobile.interieur.gouv.fr). Although digital alert systems like SAIP and cell broadcasting have become primary channels since the 2010s, the SNA sirens remain a Cold War legacy and still form an integral part of France’s civil protection strategy (Wikipedia, Civil defense siren – France, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense_siren#France).\nSources:\n    • Sénat report, Signal National d’Alerte definition: senat.fr – Rapport n° 595\n    • Ministère de l’Intérieur, Historique de l’alerte: mobile.interieur.gouv.fr – Historique de l’alerte\n    • Ministère de l’Intérieur, Comment réagir au signal national d’alerte: mobile.interieur.gouv.fr – Comment réagir\n    • Wikipedia, Civil defense siren – France: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense_siren#France",
  "Germany": "Germany’s siren signals trace their origins to Second World War air-raid alarms, where the Fliegeralarm was sounded with a two-minute wailing tone that was later standardized to one minute. In the 1950s, during the Cold War, the Federal Republic introduced a nationwide civil defense siren network, coordinated through local Warnämter (warning offices). The government adopted the Einheitssirene 1957 (E57) and other standardized models to create a dense network of about 80,000 sirens (Wikipedia, Warnung der Bevölkerung in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland). The tones were directly derived from wartime practice: the rising and falling “Heulton” (1 minute) as the warning signal and the steady tone (1 minute) as the all-clear. The rationale was that the wailing signal conveyed urgency and immediate danger, while the steady tone provided psychological closure and an unambiguous indication that the threat had passed (Wikipedia, Zivilschutzsignale; Hörmann Warnsysteme, hoermann-ws.de).\nAfter the end of the Cold War, the centralized network was dismantled in the early 1990s, with roughly half of the sirens removed and responsibility devolved to municipalities (Hörmann Warnsysteme, hoermann-ws.de). Today, there is no single binding national siren code, but since 2019 the Federal Office for Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance (BBK) recommends two basic signals: the 1-minute rising and falling tone for “Warning” and the 1-minute steady tone for “All-clear” (Wikipedia, Warnung der Bevölkerung in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland). These remain rooted in the historical rationale of distinguishability and psychological clarity, ensuring that in emergencies the public immediately recognizes the acoustic cues and turns to radio, TV, or digital services such as MoWaS and Cell Broadcast for details.\nSources:\n    • Wikipedia, Warnung der Bevölkerung in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland: de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warnung_der_Bevölkerung_in_der_Bundesrepublik_Deutschland\n    • Wikipedia, Zivilschutzsignale (German civil defense signals): de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zivilschutzsignale\n    • Hörmann Warnsysteme (manufacturer, historical overview): hoermann-ws.de – Warning systems in cities and municipalities",
  "Switzerland": "Switzerland’s nationwide siren system dates back to 1936, when the first General Alarm was introduced for air-raid defense. During the postwar period and especially the Cold War, the Federal Office for Civil Protection (FOCP) expanded and standardized the network, linking sirens into a central control system. Two main signals were established: the General Alarm, a one-minute rising and falling tone repeated once after two minutes, and the Water Alarm, consisting of twelve low continuous tones of twenty seconds each, separated by ten-second pauses (Wikipedia Civil defense siren – Switzerland, en.wikipedia.org). The rationale for introducing the Water Alarm was Switzerland’s reliance on hydroelectric dams and the need to provide unmistakable warning of possible dam failures in Alpine regions, ensuring that the public could distinguish between a general emergency and a specific flood risk (Alertswiss, FOCP, alert.swiss).\nSince the 1980s, Switzerland has conducted a nationwide annual siren test on the first Wednesday in February, involving both the General Alarm and the Water Alarm. The goal is twofold: to verify the technical reliability of the 7,200+ fixed sirens (plus mobile units) and to ensure the public maintains recognition of the distinctive signals. The FOCP emphasizes that both alarms are designed to trigger a clear behavioral response: upon hearing them, citizens are expected to go indoors and immediately tune in to radio or official information channels (Alertswiss, alert.swiss). This coupling of a distinctive acoustic pattern with broadcast instructions reflects Cold War logic—making the signals simple, uniform, and unmistakable, while relying on media to deliver detailed guidance.\nSources:\n    • Wikipedia, Civil defense siren – Switzerland: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense_siren#Switzerland\n    • Alertswiss, Federal Office for Civil Protection (FOCP): alert.swiss – Alarms and sirens",
  "Italy": "Italy’s civil defense siren system dates back to the late 1930s, when the Fascist government introduced mandatory air-raid warning infrastructure. In 1938, the War Ministry required that every city and town be equipped with at least one siren, with the production largely handled by La Sonora, a Milanese company specializing in electroacoustic devices (Italian Wikipedia, Unione nazionale protezione antiaerea). During World War II, two distinct alerts were used: the “piccolo allarme” (a preliminary signal about thirty minutes before expected air raids) and the “grande allarme” (signaling imminent danger). A steady signal indicated the end of the raid. These patterns were designed to give citizens clear advance warning and enough time to seek shelter (Italian Wikipedia, Unione nazionale protezione antiaerea; English Wikipedia, Civil defense siren – Italy).\nAfter the war, many of these sirens remained in service, often repurposed for civil protection and flood alerts, such as in Venice. In Rome, as of 2015, at least 34 wartime sirens were still installed, maintained, and occasionally tested (English Wikipedia, Civil defense siren – Italy). In recent years, Italy has shifted its focus to IT-Alert, a national cell broadcast system tested since 2019 and officially deployed in 2024. IT-Alert has already been used for real emergencies, including an explosion near Florence in December 2024, and during major events such as Pope Francis’s funeral in April 2025 (Italian Wikipedia, IT-Alert). While the acoustic sirens remain a legacy of wartime civil defense, IT-Alert represents Italy’s move toward digital mass communication, with the same goal of immediate, unmistakable warning for the public.\nSources:\n    • Italian Wikipedia: Unione nazionale protezione antiaerea — it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unione_nazionale_protezione_antiaerea\n    • English Wikipedia: Civil defense siren – Italy — en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense_siren#Italy\n    • Italian Wikipedia: IT-Alert — it.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT-Alert",
  "Sweden": "Sweden’s outdoor warning (Viktigt meddelande till allmänheten, VMA—“Hesa Fredrik”) descends from interwar/WWII air-raid practice (first public tests in 1931) and was later codified for uniform recognition. The legal baseline comes from the Civilförsvarskungörelse (1960:377), which specifies VMA as “upprepade långa ljudsegment (6–7 sekunder) åtskilda av pauser (12–14 sekunder)” and that the signal “skall omfatta minst sex ljudsegment” (official statute text, Riksdagen) (Försvarsmakten history page on “Hesa Fredrik”, forsvarsmakten.se; Civilförsvarskungörelse (1960:377), riksdagen.se / lagen.nu). The same framework differentiates VMA from the war-time flyglarm (2 s on / 2 s off for 1 min) and beredskapslarm (30 s on / 15 s off for 5 min), giving each alert a distinct acoustic “fingerprint” (MSB and Krisinformation pages) (msb.se; krisinformation.se).\nOperational guidance today reinforces that distinctiveness is the point: VMA is always sent with this exact 7 s/14 s interval, and if you hear something similar but not in that pattern, it’s likely another system (MSB “Utomhusvarning – Hesa Fredrik,” “Falsklarm”) (msb.se). The signal runs for about two minutes (six cycles) and is followed by “Faran över” (≈30 s steady) once the danger has passed; quarterly tests at 15:00 on the first non-holiday Monday of March/June/September/December maintain public recognition (MSB; Krisinformation; MSB brochures) (msb.se; krisinformation.se; MSB brochure “In case of crisis or war,” rib.msb.se). In short, while no official document spells out why “7 and 14” were chosen, the legal standardization from 1960 and current guidance show the rationale is uniform, unmistakable recognition and separation from other alarms so people immediately shelter and tune to SR P4 for instructions (riksdagen.se; msb.se; krisinformation.se).\nSources: Försvarsmakten history of “Hesa Fredrik” (forsvarsmakten.se); Civilförsvarskungörelse (1960:377) statute text (riksdagen.se; lagen.nu); MSB VMA & outdoor warning pages incl. “Falsklarm” and signal specs (msb.se); Krisinformation VMA/Warning-systems pages (krisinformation.se); MSB brochure “In case of crisis or war” (rib.msb.se",
  "Denmark": "Denmark’s modern siren system was introduced in 1993, replacing a patchwork of WWII-era alarms. The design was based on studies carried out by the Danish Emergency Management Agency (Beredskabsstyrelsen) in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which found that older tones were easily confused with fire brigade calls. To avoid confusion, the national standard settled on two core signals: a 45-second rising and falling tone (“Varsling” / Gå inden døre – Go indoors) and a 45-second steady tone (“Faren er forbi” – The danger is over). The intention was to provide a clear, recognizable acoustic pattern that would be both impossible to mistake for other uses of sirens and psychologically easy to distinguish between threat and all-clear (Beredskabsstyrelsen, siren information page; Wikipedia Warning siren in Denmark).\nThe system consists of about 1,000 electronic sirens distributed across Danish cities, covering roughly 80 % of the population. The sirens are centrally controlled by the national police and can also be triggered locally. Each year on the first Wednesday in May at 12:00, a full nationwide test is conducted: first the rising/falling “go indoors” warning, then after a pause, the steady “danger over” all-clear. This practice reinforces public familiarity and ensures technical reliability. Authorities emphasize that when people hear the rising/falling tone, they should immediately go indoors, close windows and doors, and seek information from DR (Danish Radio) or other official media channels (Beredskabsstyrelsen; Wikipedia Warning siren in Denmark).\nSources:\n    • Danish Emergency Management Agency (Beredskabsstyrelsen), official siren information: beredskabsstyrelsen.dk – Sirenerne\n    • Wikipedia, Warning siren in Denmark: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warning_siren_in_Denmark",
  "Netherlands": "The Netherlands’ network of about 4,000–4,200 public warning sirens has its roots in Cold War-era civil defense. To maintain public readiness and signal recognition, authorities began monthly nationwide tests of the system in 1952, but by 1993 this evolved into the current model: a test at 12:00 noon on the first Monday of each month, with the siren sounding continuously for 1 minute and 26 seconds. The rationale behind this specific length and frequency was twofold: to ensure techn...\nAs risks diversified—ranging from floods and chemical spills to terrorism—the Netherlands developed NL‑Alert, a Cell Broadcast system launched in the late 2000s, to provide contextual information via mobile phones. Unlike sirens, which only signal that \"something is happening,\" NL-Alert delivers a short message explaining the nature of the emergency and recommended actions. It’s designed to complement, not replace, the sirens—both for redundancy and public clarity (Everbridge case study on Dutch public ...\nSources:\n    • Stars and Stripes (2003): Resumption of monthly siren tests, rationale about public familiarity.\n    • Government.nl: Official details on monthly test timing (first Monday at 12:00, 1 min 26 s tone, emergency procedure).\n    • DutchReview: Context on historical usage and modernization of the siren system.\n    • Everbridge white paper (Ministry of Interior’s innovation): How NL-Alert augments sirens for message content.\n    • Euronews: Examples of NL-Alert usage and integration.",
  "Austria": "Austria operates one of the most structured national warning systems in Europe, with 8,200+ sirens installed across the country. The modern framework was established in the 1950s and 1960s, when Cold War preparedness led to standardizing siren tones across the federal states. The current three-signal structure was codified in the Civil Protection Act (Katastrophenschutzgesetz) of 1980: a 3-minute steady tone for “Warning”, a 1-minute rising and falling tone for “Alarm”, and a 1-minute steady tone for “All-clear.” The rationale behind this structure was to ensure differentiation: the long steady warning tone indicates general preparedness, the wailing alarm indicates immediate danger (especially air raids or disasters), and the second steady tone provides psychological closure with an unambiguous “end of danger” message (Wikipedia Warning siren in Austria; BMI – Austrian Ministry of the Interior).\nSince 1998, Austria has held a nationwide annual siren test on the first Saturday of October, during which all three signals are sounded in sequence. This not only checks technical reliability but also reinforces public awareness. Authorities emphasize that when people hear the “Alarm” signal, they should immediately seek information via ORF (Austrian Broadcasting Corporation) or official channels. The clear temporal structure of the signals, combined with annual drills, reflects Austria’s goal of making alerts unmistakable while embedding them in civic culture as part of Cold War civil defense heritage adapted for modern disaster management (BMI – Katastrophenschutz; Wikipedia Warning siren in Austria).",
  "Poland": "Poland’s warning siren signals were standardized during the 1960s, under Warsaw Pact civil defense doctrine, and remain largely unchanged today. The key patterns are a 3-minute modulated (rising and falling) tone for “General Alarm” and a 3-minute steady tone for “Alarm Cancellation/All-clear.” These signals were directly adapted from Soviet civil defense practice, where long-duration tones were intended to be unmistakable, to carry over noisy urban and industrial environments, and to be dis...\nAfter 1989, Poland modernized its civil protection framework but kept the same core acoustic signals, extending their use to cover not only military threats but also industrial accidents, floods, and other emergencies. The most recent 2025 regulation reaffirmed the use of the 3-minute modulated alarm and 3-minute steady cancellation signal as the national standard. Sirens remain under the authority of local governments but are coordinated by the national fire service and civil protection agencies.

  "Norway": "Norway’s siren system has its origins in the Second World War, when German occupation forces installed air-raid sirens in major cities. After the war, these devices were integrated into a national civil defense framework during the 1950s, under the newly formed Directorate for Civil Protection (DSB). The signals were standardized into three main alerts: “Flyalarm” (Air raid alarm), consisting of short intermittent tones for about one minute; “Viktig melding – søk informasjon” (Important messag...\nToday, Norway’s sirens are maintained by the Directorate for Civil Protection and are tested twice annually, in January and June. The most emphasized signal is Viktig melding – søk informasjon, which instructs people to go indoors, close doors and windows, and tune into NRK P1 (public radio) or other official channels for further information.

  "Finland": "Finland’s civil defense warning system is designed to alert people to immediate threats, using sirens primarily aimed at those outdoors. The “General Alarm” signal is a distinctive rising-and-falling tone lasting one minute, while the “All-clear” signal is a steady one-minute continuous tone (Rescue services guide, pelastustoimi.fi). Monthly tests are conducted at 12:00 noon on the first Monday of every month (excluding holidays), using a short continuous tone of seven seconds to help the pu...\nOperationally, the purpose of the siren system is to grab public attention and drive immediate protective behavior—specifically, “go indoors, close doors and windows… listen to radio, and wait for instructions,” while avoiding phone usage to reduce network congestion (Rescue services guide, pelastustoimi.fi).

  "Czechia": "Czechia operates one of the most distinctive warning siren systems in Europe, a legacy of its Cold War civil defense infrastructure inherited from Czechoslovakia. The central and most important signal is the “Všeobecná výstraha” (General Warning), which takes the form of a 140-second rising and falling tone. This can be repeated up to three times with pauses of around three minutes between cycles.

  "Hungary": "Hungary’s civil defense siren system has its roots in 1938, when the Minister of National Defense mandated the installation of warning sirens nationwide amid rising geopolitical tensions. Larger towns and cities received electric sirens—like the German-made FM Si 41, Swiss TESLA/Braun‐Boveri models, and domestically produced EKA and DINAMO types—while rural areas used hand-cranked versions and relied on radio broadcasts for alerts (Wikipedia, Civil defense siren – Hungary). Initially, t...\nBy 1944, the system expanded into a more graduated scheme:\n    • Air Warning—30 seconds of continuous siren when enemy forces were within 150 km;\n    • Red Alert—activated when an attack was expected within 15 minutes;\n    • Air Warning Over—signified attack subsidence;\n    • All-Clear—indicated full safety once threats moved beyond the 150 km threshold (Wikipedia, Civil defense siren – Hungary). After WWII, these systems were retained and, in the 1960s–1970s, replaced with standardized communist-era models like DDR DS977 and MEZ sirens under a major modernization effort. However, by the late 1990s, the centralized remote-control systems were deemed unreliable and dismantled as the perceived threat diminished (Wikipedia, Civil defense siren – Hungary).\nIn the mid-2000s, Hungary deployed MoLaRi—localized siren systems around hazardous material facilities—to provide targeted alerts for industrial emergencies. These systems remain active in certain counties and are tested monthly, typically the first Monday at 11:00, especially around Budapest where many hazard-prone facilities are located. A 2011 audit revealed many legacy sirens were nonfunctional; while some counties restored service, others did not, leaving a patchwork of operational readiness (Wikip...\nSources:\n    • Wikipedia, Civil defense siren – Hungary: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense_siren#Hungary\n    • Hungary Today, Monthly alarm tests & MoLaRi system: hungarytoday.hu/monthly-alarm-tests-siren-warnings-hungary-molari-system",
  "Iceland": "Iceland’s unique geological setting—marked by frequent volcanic activity, earthquakes, and extreme weather—has shaped its approach to public warning. Historically, mechanical sirens were the first form of early warning, particularly for potential military threats such as nuclear drills.
